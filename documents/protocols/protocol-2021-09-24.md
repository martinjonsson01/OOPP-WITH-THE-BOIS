# Meeting Agenda
Group: OOPP-WITH-THE-BOIS

Date: 2021-09-24

Chair: Mathias

Participants: Martin, Jonathan, Jacob, Mathias

## Objectives
* Create class diagrams for com.thebois.views and com.thebois.controllers

## Reports

PRs for Proof of Concept have been merged to master.

Starting to work on Resource Expansion.

## Discussion items
1. How do we reduce user story branch sizes, and thereby prevent huge PRs? (user story-agnostic branches?)
1. Decide on format for PRs (example below)
1. Decide on how we should name variables containing X and Y coordinates. coordinateX, posX, x?
1. Decide on javadoc parameter comment style. (periods or no? capital letters or no?)
1. How do we handle immutable objects? E.i a immutable object needs to be mutable or the reverse.


### PR template example
title: #story-branch-name
## Summary
[describe in very general terms what has been added]

## Test Coverage
[insert screenshot of coverage report of: com.thebois.model]
[insert screenshot of coverage report of: com.thebois.model.yourmodifiedpackage]

## Definition of Done
- [ ] checkboxes to check off the items required to be done

## Diagrams
[insert class diagrams and sequence diagrams you have created for the code]

Closes #USERSTORY


## Outcomes and assignments
1.  Create new branches for refactors and link them to user stories. Tasks like forgotten UML diagrams and tests can be standalone.
1. Yes, we will use the template above. The next person to do a PR should assemble the DoD.
1. Change checkstyle to allow 1 character variable name for X and Y.
1. Start Javadoc with capital letters and end with period. Whenever you encounter javadoc that doesnâ€™t follow this, change it.
1. Change Position to immutable and structure to mutable.


## Wrap up
* Continue working on assigned user stories.
* Decide who should write what in SDD and RAD.
* Next meeting on Tuesday 09:00
