1. Should we use LibGDX or JavaFX?
1. What is our Definition of Done?
1. RAD Definitions and terminology

1. What will we use Travis for?


## Outcomes and assignments 
1. Formating of user stories have been made to match the given template.
1. All our user stories fulfil the INVEST criteria.
1. UML domain diagram has been started.


### Design issues
Some design issues were encountered when adding enemy NPCs to the domain diagram. The communication between a pawn in the colony and an attacking enemy, allowing them to deal damage to and locate each other, could not be made without a double-dependency. A solution to this will have to be worked out in the next meeting.


## Wrap up
* Create project boilerplate
* Set up Maven and Travis
* RAD Definitions and terminology
* Discussion items that were not discussed will be carried over to the next meeting.
* Next meeting on Thursday 13:15
